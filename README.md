# Elevator Simulator

This is my attempt to write an Elevator running software.

The elevator on my building works perfectly fine, you never have to wait too much for it to arrive. It is never more than 3 floors away from the user. 

On the other hand, my office elevator is horrible. I spent lots of time waiting for it to arrive, it stops to pick up people even when full, wasting a lot of time. It does a lot of wierd things that made me think "This is some lousy programming".

Since I am a lousy programmer, I was hoping to at least mimic my office's elevator.

Maybe I can even make it a little bit better.
